So I finally switched from Blogger to Octopress. Main reason was that Blogger
itself is not very developer friendly especially if you want to write code like
`this is is code` in blog posts.

[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) has a wonderful documentation how to get it
running on github pages and the standard design is very good for my needs.

I managed to migrate my old (two only) blog posts from Blogger and get
everything setup on the weekend. I will maybe describe in a seperate posts how
to install, migrate, publish on Github and fine tune Octopress.

Octopress 2.0 also seems a little bit dated and has some small bugs / missing
features and I can strongly recommend the article
[Octopress Paper Cuts](http://blog.alexrothberg.com/2014/05/14/octopress-paper-cuts/)
from Alex Rothberg.

The only main thing I do not like on Octopress is that everything is Ruby/Jekyll
based with lots of dependencies (I wonder how smooth upgrading Octopress will
work out) and I wished something like [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/) (written in
go and one single binary) would have a bigger fan base. But Octopress beside
Jekyll is the [biggest player on static blog creation systems](http://www.staticgen.com/)
and has the most 3rd party plugins. A big dev community is priceless!

I also switch to my own domain entirely and the Github server which is serving
this site has enough bandwidth if I will ever write some meaningful articles
which will get linked to HN ;) :p
