    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Google was releasing Google Chrome 24 stable which should have
native MathML support. I waited for this release for a long time because
Chrome is my standard browser and I know Firefox does a very good job
with MathML since Firefox 3.</p>

<p>So I tested Chrome 24 with this MathML browser test site: <a href="http://eyeasme.com/Joe/MathML/MathML_browser_test">MathML Browser Test</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First I was very excited because the first examples looked promising and
right in Chrome. But when looking at more complex MathML Chrome rendered
it wrong.</p>

<p>I installed Chromium Dev 26.0.1380.0 and I was hoping the Chromium team
already fixed it. But my hope did not lasted long. Chromium 26 was
showing me the same results as Chrome 24. This <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=169413">bug is already reported to Chromium&rsquo;s bug tracker</a>
(star it if you&rsquo;re interested in a fix).</p>

<p>I recently installed also Opera just to cover the last to me known
modern browser which supports MathML natively (winkwink Internet
Explorer). Opera had the most issues with rendering and some serious
font problems with MathML on my Ubuntu machine.</p>

<p>So I guess we still need to use the very
good <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> JS library for a longer time to
display all kind of MathML right in every browser except Firefox.</p>

<p>Result:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firefox: Very good, near perfect native MathML support.</li>
<li>Chrome: Partial MathML support.</li>
<li>Opera: Partial MathML support but too many rendering issues.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer: No MathML support!</li>
</ul>


<p>But see the rendered browser results yourself:</p>

    <link href="https://therealmarv.com/installing-tidy-html5-on-ubuntu-first/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://therealmarv.com/installing-tidy-html5-on-ubuntu-first</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At my work (<a href="http://oerpub.org/">OERPUB</a>) we are starting to transform
any HTML and especially HTML5 content to a structured HTML5 for further
processing into various output formats (html5, epub, pdf, xml).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The problem with transforming HTML5 to a more structured HTML5 is the
parsing. The way to make this transformation is currently XSLT and we
need XML compatible (X)HTML5 for this.</p>

<p>In the past we used <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML tidy</a> which
handles all HTML soup and transforms it to valid XHTML. The only problem
is that it is dated, the last version is from <strong>2008</strong> and it does
<strong>not</strong> support HTML5 (and we also want MathML support).</p>

<p>After some searching we&rsquo;ve found
<a href="http://w3c.github.com/tidy-html5%C2%A0which">http://w3c.github.com/tidy-html5%C2%A0which</a> is a fork of tidy with support
of HTML5. After my quick tests it seems compatible with the old tidy and
(more important for me) also compatible to
<a href="http://countergram.com/open-source/pytidylib">pytidylib</a> so that I can
still use my old python code but with new HTML5 tidy options. :)</p>

<p>Here are instructions on how to replace the old HTML tidy which is
included in Ubuntu (tested on 10.04 &amp; 12.04) with the new HTML5 tidy:</p>

<p>Remove all old tidy implementations
<code>bash
sudo apt-get remove libtidy-0.99-0 tidy
</code></p>

<p>Get git, libtool and automake if you do not have them already
<code>bash
sudo apt-get install git-core automake libtool
</code>
Clone tidy-html5 repository in a directory of your choice
<code>bash
git clone https://github.com/w3c/tidy-html5
cd tidy-html5
</code></p>

<p>Building the libtidy shared library and install libtidy and tidy program (<a href="http://building%20the%20libtidy%20shared%20library/">copied from here</a>)
<code>bash
sh build/gnuauto/setup.sh &amp;&amp; ./configure &amp;&amp; make
sudo make install
</code></p>

<p>So tidy and libtidy are now installed but Ubuntu will not find
libtidy by default because libtidy installed to the folder
<code>/usr/local/lib</code> which is normally not searched for
runtime libraries. So we have to edit ldconfig&rsquo;s search folders.
Open (with root/sudo rights) the file &ldquo;/etc/ld.so.conf&rdquo;. Example:
<code>bash
gksu gedit /etc/ld.so.conf
</code></p>

<p>and add this line to the file <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>
<code>
/usr/local/lib
</code></p>

<p>Finally restart ldconfig and you are set!
<code>bash
sudo ldconfig
</code></p>

<p>Just a side note:<br/>
To remove HTML5 tidy and install old tidy again just go to its cloned
directory and type</p>

<p><code>bash
sudo make uninstall
sudo apt-get install tidy libtidy-0.99-0
</code></p>
